# StockPriceScraper

While learning CSharp a friend asked me to help him with some website scraping in python. 
While helping him, I wanted to do the same in CSharp and this is what I have done so far. 

- Uses a configuration file to set some basic paramaters and some stocks to download the data from. 
- Uses HtmlAgilityPack for easy traversing the html dom
- Uses CSVWriter to write out the results to a csv file
- Also uses some basic async and await techniques to parallelize the download process. 


If you have found this and you know how to improve, please get in contact with me.

Thank you very much.
